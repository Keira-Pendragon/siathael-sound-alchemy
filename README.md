# Siathael Sound Alchemy

An interactive tool for exploring the relationship between sounds and colors in the Siathael constructed language. This project visualizes phonetic patterns through color, helping to understand and develop the language's aesthetic and structural properties.

## Features

- **Sound-Color Mapping**: Explore relationships between phonemes and colors
- **Wave-Based Colors**: Optional mode that maps actual sound wave properties to colors
- **Custom Color Assignments**: Define and experiment with custom color mappings
- **Combination Analysis**: Study how different sound combinations create color harmonies
- **Data Collection**: Rate and analyze different combinations to discover patterns
- **Visual Feedback**: See immediate visual representation of sound combinations

## Technical Details

### Color Mapping Systems

#### Custom Mode
- Manually assigned colors based on linguistic intuition
- Preserves specifically chosen vowel colors
- Allows for artistic direction in color assignments

#### Wave Mode
- Maps phonetic frequencies to visible light spectrum
- Considers articulatory features in color generation
- Creates systematic color relationships based on sound properties

### Sound Combination Rules

- Maximum of 9 sounds per combination
- No more than 3 consecutive vowels or consonants
- Supports natural phonological patterns
- Provides feedback on combination harmony

## Development

## Linguistic Background

Siathael is a constructed language that explores the relationship between sound and meaning. The Sound Alchemy tool helps visualize and develop these relationships by:

- Mapping phonetic properties to visual elements
- Exploring natural sound combinations
- Developing systematic color relationships
- Creating aesthetic harmony guidelines

## Future Development

- [ ] Implement sound wave analysis
- [ ] Add pattern recognition algorithms
- [ ] Create export functionality for color schemes
- [ ] Develop statistical analysis tools
- [ ] Add support for additional phonetic features
